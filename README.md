# Sentiment Analysis Web App - SageMaker Deployment Project

This project deploys a sentiment analysis web app with SageMaker. The users could type in their reviews on the app web then click on Submit, the RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) model will perform sentiment analysis on the reviews, then returns if the review is positive or negative. It includes these components:
    - A deployed RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews
    - A publicly accessible API
    - Simple web page which interacts with the deployed endpoint

Please note this is a project from the Udacity Machine Learning Engineering Nanodegree Program. Some of the code templates were provided by Udacity, and I provided my codes to complete the project. Some people put the whole project on their Github repos without giving any credit to Udacity. This is not the right thing to do. As professional developers, we should give credit where credit's due. I hope this repo will help other students with their learning journey.
